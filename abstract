RstudioConf 2020 BoF Lighting Talk
Rethinking Actuarial Workflows

Spreadsheets have dominated actuarial workflows since personal computers 
became ubiquitous in the 1980s. Many actuarial analyses are have become synonymous 
with the spreadsheet templates in which are implemented, with the workflows and ways
of working of many practitioners having evolved little since that time.

This talk will present a re-imagining of a common actuarial analysis, the estimate 
of an unpaid loss reserves, implemented using an Rmarkdown/git/drake workflow. 
This example will be used to highlight common spreadsheet workflow pain points 
and explain how the suggested workflow not only mitigates these issues but also provides a
natural way to begin the process of transitioning a traditional analysis to 
incorporate modern techniques that are impossible in a spreadsheet (e.g. Machine Learning).
