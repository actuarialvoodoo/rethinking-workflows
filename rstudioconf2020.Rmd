## The Problems with Spreadsheets

* Single File Problems

* Reproducibilty Problems

* Maintainence, Update, and Validation Problems

???

A lot of these problems stem from using a spreadsheet program to build
an analysis application.

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Single File Problems

Can't be edited/fully accessed by multiple people simultaneously
 
---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Single File Problems

The agglomeration of concerns

- database

- algorithm/model 1

- algorithm/model 2

- ...

- algorithm/model N

- visualization/reporting
 
---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

* Two types of reproducibility

 - **Type I**: same input + same model -> same results

 - **Type II**: new input + same model -> analogous results

--

* Both are challenging

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

Repeating (or Updating) an analysis can be challenging because the steps of
analysis might be encodeded several different ways (even in the same analysis)

* spreadsheet formula
* macro 
* notes in a spreadsheet, or across multiple spreadsheets
* separately maintained documentation
* inside the analyst's head

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

Particularly accute when one needs to analyze an inherited spreadsheet

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

"well understood" update procedures result the "template"


---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

no ability to track changes

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

VBA Code editor is ... feature def


---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

Difficult to find errors and changes in spreadsheet formula as well as VBA logic

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

brittle to changes

## Is there a better way?

### What do we want?

* Ability to multiple people to maintain/edit/update simultaneously

* separation of concerns

* reproducible

* elastic to changes

* **source control**

* consistent starting place (like the template)

---

## Is there a better way?

### A way to get there.

* Project Template
* Rmarkdown
* git
* Drake
