## The Problems with Spreadsheets

* Single File Problems

* Reproducibilty Problems

* Maintainence, Update, and Validation Problems

???

A lot of these problems stem from using a spreadsheet program to build
an analysis application.

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Single File Problems

Can't be edited/fully accessed by multiple people simultaneously
 
---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Single File Problems

The agglomeration of concerns

- database

- algorithm/model 1

- algorithm/model 2

- ...

- algorithm/model N

- visualization/reporting
 
---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

* Two types of reproducibility

 - **Type I**: same input + same model -> same results

 - **Type II**: new input + same model -> analogous results

--

* Both are challenging

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

Repeating (or Updating) an analysis can be challenging because the steps of
analysis might be encodeded several different ways (even in the same analysis)

* spreadsheet formula
* macro 
* notes in a spreadsheet, or across multiple spreadsheets
* separately maintained documentation
* inside the analyst's head

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

Particularly accute when one needs to analyze an inherited spreadsheet

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

"well understood" update procedures result the "template"


---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

no ability to track changes

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Opacity

* Logic and orchestration embedded in macros is often opaque and difficult to maintain.
* Changes/errors may be difficult to spot because the model and view are on top of each other.

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Fragility

Once created, spreadsheet based workflows are often brittle to changes in methodology or implementation
