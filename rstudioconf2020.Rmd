## The Problems with Spreadsheets

* Single File Problems

* Reproducibilty Problems

* Maintainence, Update, and Validation Problems

???

A lot of these problems stem from using a spreadsheet program to build
an analysis application.

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Single File Problems

Can't be edited/fully accessed by multiple people simultaneously

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Single File Problems

The agglomeration of concerns

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

* Two types of reproducibility

 - **Type I**: same input + same model -> same results

 - **Type II**: new input + same model -> analogous results

--

* Both are challenging

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

Repeating (or Updating) an analysis can be challenging because the steps of
analysis might be encodeded several different ways (even in the same analysis) 
and may involve manual steps.

???

* spreadsheet formula
* macro 
* notes in a spreadsheet, or across multiple spreadsheets
* separately maintained documentation
* inside the analyst's head

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

Particularly accute when one needs to analyze an inherited spreadsheet

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Reproducibilty Problems

"well understood" update procedures result the "template"


---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

no ability to track changes

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

VBA Code editor is ... feature def


---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

Difficult to find errors and changes in spreadsheet formula as well as VBA logic

---

## The Problem with Spreadsheets

### Maintainence, Updates, and Validation Problems

brittle to changes

## Is there a better way?

### What do we want?

* Ability to multiple people to maintain/edit/update simultaneously

* separation of concerns

* reproducible

* elastic to changes

* **source control**

* consistent starting place (like the template)

---

## Is there a better way?

### A way to get there.

* Project Template
* Rmarkdown
* git
* Drake
