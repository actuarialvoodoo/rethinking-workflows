Overall plan for talk "Rethinking Actuarial Workflows"

1. Introduction
	a. Who am I?
	b. Why am I here?
	c. Funny Funny ha ha
2. Main Points
	a. I used to love spreadsheets
	    i. Easy to throw some data together and do some work
	    ii. Always available
	    iii. You *can* do anything
	    iiib. but you probably shouldn't
	    --> Empathy <--
	b. The problem with spreadsheets
	    i. Single files
	        * can't be edited by multiple people simulateously
	        * agglomeration of concerns
	            - database
	            - algorithm/model 1
	            - algorithm/model N
	            - view
	    ii. Reproducibility Problems
	        * Two types of reproducibility 
	            - same input + same model -> same results
	            - new input + same model -> analogous results
	        * Updating an analysis can be frought (steps recorded in multiple locations)
	        * Can be hard to analyze what needs to be changed in inherited spreadsheet
	        * "well understood" update procedures results in the "template"
	    iii. Maintainence, Updates, and Validation
	        * no ability to track changes
	        * VBA Code editor is ... feature deficient
	        * Difficult to find errors and changes spreadsheet formula
	        * as well as VBA logic
	        * brittle to changes
	c. A better way?
	    i. What do we want?
	        * ability for multiple people to maintain/edit/update simultaneously
	        * separation of concerns
	        * reproducible
	        * elastic to changes
	        * source control
	        * consistent starting place (like the template)
	    ii. A way to get there
	        * Project Template
	        * Rmarkdown
	        * git
	        * Drake
